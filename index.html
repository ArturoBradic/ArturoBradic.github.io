        <p> Hello Fam </p>
        <p> It's been a while since I have posted to my PLETHORA of fans and I'm sure you guys have been on the edge of your seats just
        clenching your teeth waiting for more news. Well, web development classes officially start next week through the program at my good ole' alma
        mater the University of Arizona bear down ay. The plan is I'll work full time 8-5 at my ophthalmology job and then take classes
        6:30-9:30 T,TH,F after work plus Saturday mornings, not to mention the time spent doing homework and raw coding on the days I
        don't have class, as well as try to squeeze in time to go to the gym and sleep. *exhale* Not to fret though- it's a good thing I don't have friends in Phoenix
        because I don't have to worry about a social life LMAOOOOO. But I'm excited and anxious to start. In the meantime, here's a game I pseudocoded
        as part of my required prework.</p>
        <p>Enjoy! <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/250875988/" target="_blank">Defend North Korea!</a></p>

    <p> September sixteenth, two thousand eighteen: </p>
    <p> It is Sunday. I'm sitting at my desk in my small but well-decorated
      apartment thanks partly (mostly) to my roommate. I'm sipping on a cup of
      jasmine cheese tea from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x872b07e2484438b5%3A0x50eaa24cd30d63b5!2m20!8m2!1m1!1e2!16m16!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e6!2m2!1m1!1e4!2m2!1m1!1e5!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPdT3ETbHWbHGP_pERq5MLRTHosdzHPHm-ZGU9o%3Dw240-h320-k-no!5sboba%20tree%20-%20Google%20Search&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipNRjNecIgjmYSODxETX-oFIuEFU3b6bl70sERvs&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwiDmdOFs8HdAhVkzlQKHVOWA4AQoiowD3oECAoQCQ&activetab=panorama">Boba Tree</a> so I have that lingering sweet herbal taste in my mouth.</p>
      <p> Anyway, I've been working on the website for a
    few days now and I'm happy to say I've learned a bit of CSS since last time
    I made an appearance so my project has some tender meat and fat on its bones
    (I'm hungry) and is now fully-functional, although bare.</p>
    <p>Here's an update:</p>

      <p> September twelve, two thousand eighteen: </p>
      <p> I am currently sitting in a crowded <a href="https://www.cartelcoffeelab.com/pages/ash-avenue">coffee shop</a> situated in the center of Tempe, Arizona
      listening to a low-fi jazz playlist on Spotify. This is my first time writing html code and
      slowly seeing the beginnings of what will eventually become my cyber baby is very exciting. </p>
      <p> While I am enveloped in my world learning divs
      and classes, there are two men sitting to my right playing an intense game of Scrabble as a university student
      diagonally from me is very evidently struggling with college physics. The taste of my chai is sweet and <strong>aromatic.</strong>
      (I just learned font-weights)</p>
      <p> This is currently what my website looks like. Slow and steady...</p>
